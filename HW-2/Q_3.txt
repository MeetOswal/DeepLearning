The standard self-attention mechanism computes the attention weights by taking the dot product of the query and key vectors, applying a softmax operation, and then multiplying by the value vector. This process involves a matrix multiplication operation which has a time complexity of $$O(T^2)$$ for an input with $$T$$ tokens.
In contrast, the linear self-attention mechanism you described simplifies the computation by dropping the exponentials in the softmax operation. This means that instead of computing $$e^{QK}$$, we just use $$QK$$ directly. This avoids the need for a matrix multiplication operation, which is the primary source of the quadratic time complexity in the standard self-attention mechanism.
Instead, the linear self-attention mechanism involves a series of vector operations (addition, multiplication, and normalization), each of which can be performed in linear time. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the linear self-attention mechanism is $$O(T)$$, which is significantly more efficient than the standard self-attention mechanism for large inputs.
However, it's important to note that while this simplification can significantly improve computational efficiency, it may also impact the performance of the model, as the softmax operation plays a crucial role in controlling the distribution of the attention weights. The impact on performance would need to be evaluated empirically.
